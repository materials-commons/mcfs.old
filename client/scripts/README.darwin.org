* Run in background on Mac
  To run the materials server in the background on the Mac we use launchctl to launch the
  server at login. The file org.materialscommons.materials.plist contains the setup for
  launching the materials server at login.
*** Steps
    - cp materials /usr/local/bin
    - cp org.materialscommons.materials.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
    - launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/org.materialscommons.materials.plist
