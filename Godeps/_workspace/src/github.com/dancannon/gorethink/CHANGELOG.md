# Changelog

## v0.2 (RethinkDB v1.12) - 13 April

* Changed `Connect` to use `ConnectOpts` instead of `map[string]interface{}`
* Migrated to new `Group`/`Ungroup` functions, these replace `GroupedMapReduce` and `GroupBy`
* Added new aggregators
* Removed base parameter for `Reduce`
* Added `Object` function
* Added `Upcase`, `Downcase` and `Split` string functions
* Added `GROUPED_DATA` pseudotype
* Fixed query printing

## v0.1 (RethinkDB v1.11) - 27 November 2013

 * Added noreply writes
 * Added the new terms `index_status`, `index_wait` and `sync`
 * Added the profile flag to the run functions
 * Optional arguments are now structs instead of key, pair strings. Almost all of the struct fields are of type interface{} as they can have terms inside them. For example: `r.TableCreateOpts{ PrimaryKey: r.Expr("index") }`
 * Returned arrays are now properly loaded into ResultRows. In the past when running `r.Expr([]interface{}{1,2,3})` would require you to use `RunRow` followed by `Scan`. You can now use `Run` followed by `ScanAll`
