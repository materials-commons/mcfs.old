FUNCTIONS

func Deploy(downloaded string) bool
    Deploy attempts to deploy the new materials website archive. It will
    replace the current archive with newly downloaded one and unpack it.

func Download() (to string, err error)
    Download will attempt to download the materials.tar.gz file from the
    MCDownload site. If it downloads the file it will return the path to the
    downloaded file. It downloads to the OS TempDir.

func IsNew(downloaded string) bool
    IsNew checks if a downloaded file is newer than the current file. It
    does this by comparing the checksum of the currently downloaded file to
    the newly downloaded one. If they are different then it assumes the new
    one is more recent. If there is no currently downloaded file then by
    default the new one is more recent.
