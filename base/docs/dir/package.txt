FUNCTIONS

func Diff(originalVersion *Directory, newerVersion *Directory) []Patch
    Diff compares two versions of a directory tree over time. The first
    directory is the original or older version. The second directory is the
    new version. Diff creates a list of patches that will take the original
    version and transform it into the newer version.

func DiffFlat(origFiles, newFiles []FileInfo) []Patch
    DiffFlat compares two versions of a directory tree over time. It is like
    Diff except that it expects to receive flattened, sorted lists of the
    two directories contents.


TYPES

type Directory struct {
    FileInfo                             // Information about the directory
    Files          []FileInfo            // List of files and directories in this directory
    SubDirectories map[string]*Directory // List of directories in this directory
}
    Directory is a container for the files and sub directories in a single
    directory. Each sub directory will itself contain a list of files and
    directories.


func Load(path string) (*Directory, error)
    Load walks a given directory path creating a Directory object with all
    files and sub directories filled out.


func (d *Directory) Flatten() []FileInfo
    Flatten takes a Directory and flattens it into a list of file objects
    sorted by full path. It does this for the entire set of files, including
    files in sub directories.


type FileInfo struct {
    ID       string    // ID of file/directory
    Path     string    // Full path including name
    Size     int64     // Size valid only for file
    Checksum string    // MD5 Hash - valid only for files
    MTime    time.Time // Modification time
    IsDir    bool      // True if this entry represents a directory
}
    FileInfo describes a file or directory entry



type Patch struct {
    File FileInfo
    Type PatchType
}
    Patch is an instance of a difference when comparing two directories. It
    specifies the kind of change to apply.



type PatchType int
    PatchType denotes the kind of patch operation

const (
    // PatchCreate created item
    PatchCreate PatchType = iota

    // PatchDelete deleted item
    PatchDelete

    // PatchEdit item content was changed
    PatchEdit

    // PatchConflict there is a conflict with the specified file
    PatchConflict
)
