TYPES

type Decoder interface {
    Decode(buf []byte, out interface{}) error
    Prepare(buf []byte) (*PreparedBuffer, error)
}
    Decoder is the interface implemented by an object that can be decoded
    after stripping out its tag type and version.



type Encoder interface {
    Encode(otype uint8, version uint8, in interface{}) (*bytes.Buffer, error)
}
    Encoder is the interface implemented by an object that can encode itself
    and tag its type and version.



type EncoderDecoder interface {
    Encoder
    Decoder
}
    EncoderDecoder implements both encoding and decoding.



type PreparedBuffer struct {
    Type    uint8
    Version uint8
    Bytes   []byte
}
    PreparedBuffer represents a buffer stream with the first two bytes (type
    and version) removed.
