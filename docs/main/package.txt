COMMAND DOCUMENTATION

    This package implements the Materials Commons File Server service. This
    service provides upload/download of datafiles from the Materials Commons
    repository.

    The protocol for file uploads looks as follows:

	1. The client sends the size, checksum and path. If the file
	   is an existing file then it also sends the DataFileID for
	   the file.
	2. If the server receives a DataFileID it checks the size
	   and checksum against what was sent. If the checksums
	   match and the sizes are different then its a partially
	   completed upload. If the checksums are different then
	   its a new upload.
	3. The server sends back the DataFileID. It will create a
	   new DataFileID or send back an existing depending on
	   whether its a new upload or an existing one.
	4. The server will tell the client the offset to start
	   sending data from. For a new upload this will be at
	   position 0. For an existing one it will be the offset
	   to restart the upload.

    The protocol for file downloads looks as follows:
