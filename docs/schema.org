* Overview
  This document describes the current schema for Materials
  Commons. There are two schemas described here. The "External Schema"
  is the schema exposed to client side (REST) services. The "Internal
  Schema" is the mapping of this schema into our database. Materials
  Commons uses a JSON document store for its backend database service.

  All communication with Materials Commons services uses JSON as its
  interchange format. Because it can be difficult to see entities in
  the raw JSON the schema below is represented using GO
  structs. Internally these are translated from/to JSON.

	DirectoryID string `json:"directory_id"`
	Checksum    string `json:"checksum"`
	Owner       string `json:"owner"`
